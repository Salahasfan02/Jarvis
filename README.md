# 🟢 Jarvis

### A private, local AI operating system for your Mac.

**Voice. Vision. Automation. Memory. 100% on your machine — no cloud, no API keys, no subscriptions.**

Jarvis turns your MacBook into the AI assistant from the movies: talk to it, let it see your screen and camera, control your apps, remember everything about you, and get real work done — all powered by local LLMs through [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Nothing ever leaves your Mac.

## 🧠 Why Jarvis?

Every AI assistant wants your data in the cloud. Jarvis doesn't.

- **🔒 Totally private** — runs on local models via Ollama. No accounts, no API keys, no telemetry. Your conversations, screen, camera, files, and memories never leave your machine.
- **🎙️ Voice-first** — say *"Jarvis…"* and it wakes up (with a chime), listens with **offline Whisper**, and replies in a **human neural voice**. Have a real back-and-forth conversation, hands-free.
- **👁️ It can actually see** — reads your screen with Apple's OCR, watches through your camera, and answers questions about whatever's in front of you.
- **🦾 It does things** — opens apps, controls your browser, plays music, drafts emails, manages files, runs code — with a permission prompt before anything touches your system.
- **🧩 It's an OS, not a chatbot** — a living command-center dashboard with agents, projects, long-term memory, and a plugin system it can extend *itself*.
- **🆓 Free & source-available** — free for any **noncommercial** use. Fork it, hack it, make it yours.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> ⚠️ **Check your Python first.** macOS ships with Python 3.9, and the backend **cannot install** on it — `onnxruntime` publishes no 3.9 wheel, so `pip` fails with `ResolutionImpossible`. Step 1 below is not optional.

```bash
# 1. Python 3.11+  —  macOS's built-in python3 is 3.9 and will not work
python3 --version                 # 3.11 or newer? skip to step 2
brew install python@3.12          # otherwise, install a supported one

# 2. Install Ollama and pull a model (https://ollama.com/download)
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b

# 3. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Salahasfan02/Jarvis.git
cd Jarvis

# 4. Build the backend environment with an explicit 3.11+ interpreter.
#    (start.sh calls a bare `python3`, which on a stock Mac is 3.9 — so create
#    the venv yourself and start.sh will use it as-is.)
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv backend/.venv

# 5. Run everything with one command
chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
```

Your browser opens at **http://localhost:5173** and Jarvis is live. Press **Ctrl+C** (or `./stop.sh`) to turn it off. Nothing auto-starts; it only runs when you start it.

> 🔧 **First launch — set your model.** The dashboard will say `llama3.1`, which is the built-in default in `backend/app/config.py` and is *not* the model you pulled above. Open **Settings → Model** and select `qwen2.5:14b`, or your first message will fail against a model you don't have. (Alternatively, `ollama pull llama3.1` and skip the switch.)

> 🔐 **macOS will ask for permissions.** The first time Jarvis reads your screen, uses the camera, or drives another app, macOS prompts for **Screen Recording**, **Camera**, **Microphone**, and **Accessibility**. Grant them in System Settings → Privacy & Security. Screen OCR and app automation silently return nothing until you do.

<details>
<summary><b>Prefer the native desktop app?</b></summary>

The Electron shell is a **wrapper around the running stack**, not a standalone build — in dev it loads the Vite UI from `http://localhost:5173`, and it launches the backend using `backend/.venv`. So bring the stack up first:

```bash
./start.sh          # terminal 1 — leave this running

cd desktop          # terminal 2
npm install
npm start           # or: npm run package  → builds Jarvis.app
```

The desktop app adds a menu-bar icon, the **⌥Space** quick command, a **⌘⇧J** floating window, and "Open at Login."

Note that `npm run package` records the path to *this clone's* backend in `~/.jarvis/backend_path`. The resulting `Jarvis.app` still needs this repo on disk — a fully self-contained bundle is on the [roadmap](#️-roadmap).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Run each piece manually</b></summary>

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Ollama
ollama serve

# Terminal 2 — backend   (use an explicit 3.11+ interpreter, not bare `python3`)
cd backend && /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python run.py            # → http://127.0.0.1:8765

# Terminal 3 — UI
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5173
```

</details>

### Level up (optional, all local)

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text   # semantic memory + smarter agent routing
ollama pull llava              # camera & screen vision
```

Then open **Settings** to enable them, download the offline **Whisper** and human **Kokoro** voice models, pick your theme, and set your wake word.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b><code>ResolutionImpossible</code> / "no matching distributions available for onnxruntime"</b></summary>

You built the environment with Python 3.9 (macOS's default). Delete it and rebuild with 3.11+:

```bash
rm -rf backend/.venv
brew install python@3.12
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv backend/.venv
./start.sh
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'</code> (or similar) on every run</b></summary>

You have a **half-built venv**. If the dependency install fails partway, the empty `backend/.venv` directory is left behind — and because `start.sh` only installs when that directory is *missing*, every later run skips the install and launches against an empty environment. The fix is the same as above: `rm -rf backend/.venv`, then recreate it with a 3.11+ interpreter.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>First message fails with a model error</b></summary>

The active model doesn't exist locally. Run `ollama list` to see what you actually have, then pick one of those in **Settings → Model**. The out-of-the-box default is `llama3.1`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The desktop app opens a blank window</b></summary>

In dev mode it loads `http://localhost:5173`, so the Vite dev server has to be running — start the stack with `./start.sh` before `npm start`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Ctrl+C didn't stop everything</b></summary>

`./start.sh` cleans up when you interrupt it from the terminal it's running in. If you launched it detached (`nohup`, `&`, or from another script), the backend and UI survive — use `./stop.sh`, which kills by port instead. Add `--all` to stop Ollama too.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Screen reading, camera, or app automation does nothing</b></summary>

Missing macOS permissions. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security and grant **Screen Recording**, **Camera**, **Microphone**, and **Accessibility** to your terminal (or to Jarvis.app if you packaged it), then restart Jarvis.
</details>

## 📋 Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **OS** | macOS on Apple Silicon (built & tested on an M-series Mac) |
| **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** | with at least one model (e.g. `qwen2.5:14b`) |
| **Python** | **3.11+** — macOS's built-in `python3` is 3.9 and will not install the backend. `brew install python@3.12` |
| **Node.js** | 18+ |
| **RAM** | 16 GB minimum, 24 GB+ recommended for larger models |
| **Permissions** | Screen Recording, Camera, Microphone, Accessibility (prompted on first use) |

> 💡 **Model tip:** `qwen2.5:14b` is the sweet spot for tool-calling on a 16–24 GB Mac. The app is fully model-agnostic — switch models anytime in Settings, and even benchmark them on your hardware.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

Jarvis is built to earn your trust:

- **Runs 100% locally** — the only network calls are the web-search tools *you* invoke.
- **Permission system** — every action has a risk level. Safe actions run instantly; anything that touches your system (shell, AppleScript, deleting files) asks first, every time.
- **Audit log** — every tool call, confirmation, and denial is recorded.
- **You always press send** — messages and emails are only ever *drafted*.
- **Sandboxed code** — generated code runs with no network and confined file access.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Backend:** FastAPI · Ollama · SQLite · faster-whisper (STT) · Kokoro (TTS) · Apple Vision (OCR) · pyobjc
**Frontend:** React · TypeScript · Vite
**Desktop:** Electron (tray, global hotkeys, floating window)

Modular by design — new tools, agents, models, and integrations drop in without touching the core. See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Encrypted memory & conversation storage
- [ ] First-run setup wizard (auto-pulls the right models)
- [ ] Version check + explicit interpreter selection in `start.sh`
- [ ] Self-contained `.app` (bundled backend)
- [ ] Meeting transcription with speaker separation
- [ ] Git integration in the coding workspace
- [ ] Community skill & plugin packs

---

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs, ideas, and bug reports are welcome. Jarvis is designed to be extended — writing a new tool or plugin is a few lines of Python (see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)).
